### Types of bans
### Social Club Ban: 

The Social Club ban is not a GTA Online ban this ban suspends you from all Rockstar (R*) Online Sercvices for 30 days.

### GTA Ban:

The player account will be suspended for 30 days on the first ban, it will also be completely reset.
With the second ban, the GTA account is permanently excluded from GTA Online, which means you need a new account to be able to play GTA Online again.



### What should I avoid when modding to not get banned?

You should not make money drops for yourself or others when modding, you should not fly across the map, and trolling people with godmode is also a bad idea.
